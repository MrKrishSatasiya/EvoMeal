                    answer: "User stories describe a feature from the user's perspective and explain the type of user, what they want, and why. Acceptance criteria, on the other hand, provide specific conditions that the feature must meet to satisfy the user story. They are more detailed and testable than the user story itself."

                    answer: "While it's best to have stable acceptance criteria, they can be refined or adjusted during development if new information comes to light. However, any changes should be carefully considered and communicated to all stakeholders, as they may impact the scope, timeline, or resources required for the project."

                    question: "How do acceptance criteria relate to testing?",
                    answer: "Acceptance criteria serve as the foundation for acceptance testing. They define what needs to be tested and what conditions must be met for the feature to pass. Testers use these criteria to design test cases and scenarios, ensuring that all specified requirements are thoroughly validated before the feature is considered complete."

                    answer: "Acceptance criteria are specific to individual user stories or features, defining when that particular item is complete. The definition of done, however, is a broader set of criteria that applies to all work items in a project, encompassing quality standards, documentation requirements, and other general conditions that must be met for any item to be considered fully complete."

                    answer: "A professional bio is a brief summary of your work experience, skills, and achievements. It is important because it serves as your introduction to potential employers, clients, or colleagues, helping you make a strong first impression and showcase your expertise. A well-written bio can enhance your personal brand, improve your visibility in professional networks, and open up new career opportunities."

Whether you want it to be formal, friendly, or somewhere in between, you can indicate your preference to ensure the bio aligns with your personal brand and the context in which it will be used. Different platforms may require different tones - LinkedIn might be more formal, while Twitter might be more casual."

                    question: "How can I make my professional bio stand out?",

Consider your audience and industry norms - what works for a creative agency might not be appropriate for a law firm."

A long version for your website or speaking engagements, a medium version for LinkedIn, and a short version for social media profiles or brief introductions. Each version should maintain consistency in your core message while being optimized for its specific platform and purpose."

Also avoid including outdated information, irrelevant details, or controversial topics."
